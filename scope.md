# Scope

This document outlines the scope of work undertaken by the Creator Assertions Working Group’s Metadata Assertion project.

## Objectives

The objective of this project is to provide a canonical C2PA 2.0-compliant metadata assertion which allows actors to express metadata that is not directly machine-attestable.

The `c2pa.metadata` assertion was narrowed in scope in the C2PA 2.0 specification. This project will re-publish a more permissive specification as a product of the Creator Assertions Working Group.

## Membership and joining

This specification is being developed under the [Community Specification 1.0 License](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/1.0/1._Community_Specification_License-v1.md). Contributors to this specification must adhere to the license, as outlined in the repository’s [license file](/license.md) file.

## Deliverables

This Working Group shall produce a version 1.0 of an metadata assertion specification which shall reflect the consensus of the members at that time. The Working Group may produce subsequent versions of the specification.

## Meeting schedule and notes

See [CAWG: Meeting schedule](https://creator-assertions.github.io/#_meeting_schedule) for meeting schedule and notes from previous meetings.

## Dependencies

The metadata assertion specification must align with the C2PA Technical Specification that is current as of the time of publication. The specification may also describe compatibility with previous versions of the C2PA Technical Specification.

## About this document

Any changes of Scope are not retroactive.
